Tutorial:
	- When starting the app, click anywhere to begin. Click 'q' to quit anytime.
	- Click anywhere on screen to move the mouse pointer.
	- Click on a color on the lefthand side to select it.
	- To toggle drawing (i.e. go from navigation to drawing mode), press 'w'.
	- Use the arrow keys to draw lines.
	- Press 'd' to dither.

	Bugs:
		- 'p' is for 'pen' mode (I forget what it does, but it shifts the screen up in a weird way).
		- v: make an SVG output image (doesn't work anymore).
		- e: export (doesn't work anymore).
